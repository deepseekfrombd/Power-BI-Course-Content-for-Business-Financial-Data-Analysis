# Power BI Service & Collaboration - DAX Reference

This guide provides an overview and reference for using DAX in Power BI Service & Collaboration, especially within a financial context.

---

## 1. Publishing Reports to Power BI Service

### DAX Tip:
- Ensure all DAX measures are optimized before publishing to reduce dataset size and improve performance.

### Example:
```dax
TotalRevenue = SUM(Sales[Revenue])
```

---

## 2. Creating Dashboards and Workspaces

### DAX Tip:
- Use explicit DAX measures for visual consistency across dashboards.

### Example:
```dax
AverageSpend = AVERAGE(Transactions[Amount])
```

---

## 3. Row-Level Security (RLS) for Sensitive Financial Data

### DAX Tip:
- Define roles using DAX filters to restrict access.

### Example Role Filter (for Department = "Finance"):
```dax
[Department] = "Finance"
```

---

## 4. Sharing Reports Securely with Stakeholders

### DAX Tip:
- Combine user-based functions like `USERNAME()` with RLS for dynamic security.

### Example:
```dax
UserAccess = LOOKUPVALUE(UserPermissions[AccessLevel], UserPermissions[Username], USERNAME())
```

---

## 5. Setting Up Scheduled Data Refresh

### DAX Tip:
- Avoid non-deterministic functions in DAX (like `NOW()`, `TODAY()`) for datasets with scheduled refresh.

### Best Practice:
Instead of this:
```dax
TodaySales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[Date] = TODAY())
```
Use this (with a parameter table):
```dax
TodaySales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[Date] = SELECTEDVALUE(DateTable[TodayDate]))
```

---

## 6. Using Power BI Apps for Organizational Distribution

### DAX Tip:
- Create DAX measures that clearly label KPIs and financial metrics to enhance understanding when distributed via apps.

### Example:
```dax
ProfitMargin = DIVIDE(SUM(Financials[Profit]), SUM(Financials[Revenue]), 0)
```

---

### General Best Practices
- Keep DAX code clean and well-commented.
- Use variables (`VAR`) for complex logic to improve readability and performance.
- Test DAX expressions thoroughly in Power BI Desktop before publishing.
