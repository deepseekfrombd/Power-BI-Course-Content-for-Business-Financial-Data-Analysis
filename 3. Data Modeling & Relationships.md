# Module 3: Data Modeling & Relationships — Step-by-Step Guide

---

## Step 1: Create Your Data Model

- After loading data into Power BI Desktop, go to the **Model** view  
- Visualize all tables loaded in your report  
- Identify primary keys and foreign keys in your data  

---

## Step 2: Define Relationships Between Tables

- Drag and drop fields between tables to create relationships  
- Common relationship types:  
  - One-to-many (most common)  
  - Many-to-one  
- Ensure **cardinality** is correct (e.g., one customer has many transactions)  
- Set **cross-filter direction** (single or both) as needed  

---

## Step 3: Understand Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema

- **Star Schema:**  
  - Central fact table (e.g., sales, transactions)  
  - Connected to multiple dimension tables (e.g., customers, products)  
  - Simple and efficient for queries  

- **Snowflake Schema:**  
  - Dimensions normalized into multiple related tables  
  - More complex but reduces redundancy  
  - Use if you have complex hierarchies or large dimensions  

---

## Step 4: Handle Many-to-Many Relationships

- Use a **bridge table** to resolve many-to-many relationships  
- Example: Customers ↔ Products with multiple purchases  
- Power BI supports direct many-to-many relationships but bridge tables improve clarity and performance  

---

## Step 5: Manage Date Tables and Time Intelligence

- Create or import a dedicated **Date Table** with continuous dates  
- Mark your Date Table as a **Date Table** in Power BI  
- Use built-in time intelligence DAX functions like:  
  - `TOTALYTD()`, `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR()`, `DATESINPERIOD()`  
- This enables accurate time-based calculations  

---

## Step 6: Calculated Columns vs Measures — When to Use Which?

- **Calculated Columns:**  
  - Computed row-by-row during data refresh  
  - Stored in the data model  
  - Use for static data attributes or filtering  

- **Measures:**  
  - Calculated dynamically based on user interaction  
  - Efficient and recommended for aggregations and calculations  
  - Use for sums, averages, ratios, KPIs  

---

## Step 7: Create Hierarchies for Drill-Downs

- In Model view, right-click a table and select **Create Hierarchy**  
- Add related fields (e.g., Year > Quarter > Month)  
- Use hierarchies in visuals for intuitive drill-down navigation

# Summary

By completing Module 3 practice, you will be able to:

- Build effective data models with proper relationships  
- Choose appropriate schema types for your data  
- Handle complex many-to-many relationships  
- Use date tables to leverage time intelligence  
- Understand and apply calculated columns vs measures  
- Build hierarchies for interactive drill-down reports
