# Module 8: Power BI & Excel Integration - DAX Reference

This reference outlines how DAX functions and concepts apply within the context of integrating Power BI and Excel.

---

## 1. Exporting Power BI Data to Excel for Further Analysis

### DAX Tip:
- Use concise, named measures to make exported data more readable.

### Example:
```dax
TotalSales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
```

> Tip: Avoid exporting large datasets. Summarized DAX measures reduce Excel file size and improve clarity.

---

## 2. Using Analyze in Excel Feature

### DAX Tip:
- Pre-create all necessary DAX measures in your Power BI dataset. These are the only calculations visible when analyzing in Excel.

### Example:
```dax
NetProfit = [TotalRevenue] - [TotalCost]
```

> Tip: Measures appear in the PivotTable Fields list when using Analyze in Excel.

## 3. Power BI Dataflows and Excel Power Query

### DAX Tip:
- While DAX is not used directly in dataflows, consistent naming of DAX measures helps downstream Excel users understand calculations.

> Note: Dataflows are transformed using Power Query (M language), not DAX. But they feed into Power BI models that use DAX.

---

## 4. Using Excel as a Data Source for Power BI

### DAX Tip:
- After loading Excel data into Power BI, define necessary DAX measures rather than calculated columns to improve performance.

### Example:
```dax
AvgUnitPrice = AVERAGE(Products[UnitPrice])
```

> Tip: Use Power Query to clean and shape Excel data before loading into the model.

---

### General Best Practices

- Name DAX measures clearly for Excel users.
- Keep DAX logic centralized in measures for portability between Power BI and Excel.
- Document assumptions behind DAX calculations for users consuming the data via Excel.
