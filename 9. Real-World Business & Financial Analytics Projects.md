# Module 9: Real-World Business & Financial Analytics Projects - DAX Reference

This DAX reference supports key financial analytics projects, enabling robust and accurate reporting in Power BI.

## 1. Financial Statement Dashboard (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)

### Example Measures:
```dax
TotalRevenue = SUM(Financials[Revenue])
GrossProfit = [TotalRevenue] - [CostOfGoodsSold]
NetIncome = [GrossProfit] - [OperatingExpenses] - [Taxes]
CashInflow = SUM(CashFlow[CashIn])
CashOutflow = SUM(CashFlow[CashOut])
NetCashFlow = [CashInflow] - [CashOutflow]
```

> Tip: Use switch-based measures to display specific financial statements by slicer selection.

---

## 2. Sales Performance and Forecasting Dashboard

### Example Measures:
```dax
TotalSales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
SalesGrowth = ([TotalSales] - [PreviousPeriodSales]) / [PreviousPeriodSales]
ForecastedSales = [TotalSales] * (1 + ForecastParameters[GrowthRate])
```

### Previous Period Sales:
```dax
PreviousPeriodSales = CALCULATE([TotalSales], DATEADD(Date[Date], -1, MONTH))
```

---

## 3. Budget vs Actual Variance Analysis

### Example Measures:
```dax
BudgetAmount = SUM(Budget[Amount])
ActualAmount = SUM(Actuals[Amount])
Variance = [ActualAmount] - [BudgetAmount]
VariancePct = DIVIDE([Variance], [BudgetAmount], 0)
```

---

## 4. Customer Profitability and Segment Analysis

### Example Measures:
```dax
CustomerRevenue = CALCULATE([TotalRevenue], Customer[CustomerType] = "Retail")
CustomerProfit = [CustomerRevenue] - [CustomerCost]
ProfitPerCustomer = DIVIDE([CustomerProfit], DISTINCTCOUNT(Customer[CustomerID]), 0)
```

---

## 5. Expense Tracking and Cost Analysis

### Example Measures:
```dax
TotalExpenses = SUM(Expenses[Amount])
CostPerUnit = DIVIDE([TotalExpenses], SUM(Production[UnitsProduced]), 0)
ExpenseGrowth = ([TotalExpenses] - [LastMonthExpenses]) / [LastMonthExpenses]
```

---

## 6. Scenario Planning & Sensitivity Analysis

### Example (Using What-If Parameters):
```dax
AdjustedRevenue = [TotalRevenue] * SELECTEDVALUE(GrowthRate[GrowthFactor], 1)
AdjustedCost = [TotalCost] * SELECTEDVALUE(CostInflation[InflationFactor], 1)
ProjectedProfit = [AdjustedRevenue] - [AdjustedCost]
```

> Tip: Use slicers with What-If parameter tables to simulate different business scenarios.

---

## 7. KPI Scorecards and Executive Dashboards

### Example KPI Measures:
```dax
KPI_ProfitMargin = DIVIDE([NetIncome], [TotalRevenue], 0)
KPI_SalesTargetMet = IF([TotalSales] >= [SalesTarget], "Yes", "No")
KPI_CustomerSatisfaction = AVERAGE(Surveys[SatisfactionScore])
```

> Tip: Use KPI visuals and conditional formatting to enhance executive dashboards.

---

### General Best Practices

- Use variables (`VAR`) for clarity and performance.
- Create reusable DAX measures across multiple visuals.
- Include error handling with `DIVIDE` and `IFERROR` patterns.
